# opentok_flutter

A basic OpenTok plugin for Flutter. Currently only supports Android & iOS. This plugin only supports 1v1 video calls with OpenTok.

## Getting Started

In order to do OpenTok video call you need a TokBox/OpenTok account. After you signup, create a project & navigate to OpenTok Playground. You can generate required `apiKey`, `sessionId` & `token` from there.
